I love to read, it is the way I spend a good part of my spare time. Books allow you to travel without moving and provide a way to learn and explore. Throughout the years I have been reading a lot of books, here I just want to write down some of them.


* 21 lecciones para el siglo XXI - Juval Noah Harari (2018) (spanish)
* Black holes & time warps - Kip Thorne (english)
