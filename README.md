# Andrea Merlina's website

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

Moreover I would like to thank
* Jordi Pont-Tuset
* Roberto Reale
for the inspiration of the design

Feel free to adapt this theme to your site without linking back to me or including a disclaimer, although letting me know would be nice. ;)
