Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is a service that manages in a centralized and granular way security related to SaaS.

CASB capabilities can be categorized in 4 key points:

1. Visibility and Monitoring
2. Data Security
    * Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
        * Dictionaries
        * Regular expressions
        * Watermarking
        * Data classification
    * Encryption and Tokenization
3. Threat Protection
    * Signature
    * Sandboxing
4. Compliance with legal directives

DLP can be enforced only in services and segments of networks that are visible. Thanks to their overarching reach, CASBs are good enforcement points.

In general the enforcement is reactive since is happens after a periodic polling of logs from SaaS provider.
