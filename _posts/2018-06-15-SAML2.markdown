SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is a standard to provide:

* Authentication. Are you the one you claim to be?

* Authorization. Given that you are who you claim to be, are you allowed to do that?

The involved actors are:

1. The Client
2. Service Provider (SP)
3. Identity Provider (IdP)

The Client is interested to use a service provided by the SP but it needs guarantees that it can do that. The role of the IdP is to make that claim, asserting the trustworthiness of the Client.

Logically, the interaction can be pictured as showed in the image below.

The obvious advantage is that the Client has to prove his identity just once to the IdP, which is indeed used as Single Sign On (SSO).

It has to be noted that SAML doesn't restrict the authentication method between the Client and the IdP. It may be username + password or other form of authentication, including Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).

Anyway the protocol provides for an exchange of more messages.
