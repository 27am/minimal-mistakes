I read a lot because I love it.
Here there are some points

1. Gather contextual information about the book
2. Read it taking notes on the margins
3. After every paragraph pause and reflect on what you have been reading.
4. When you finish the book wait one week, then review its structure, the main concepts and your notes.
5. Find your personal way to index the knowledge you just aquired.

Okay so this is the shortlist of the steps I try to follow. Sometimes I find myself skipping some of those points although as a rule I try to stick to them. Let's have a look a bit more in detail.


###  Gather contextual information about the book
Every book has a story behind that is not told in its pages. The author is very likely to have spent 10 times more time writing them than you reading.
Moreover every person is the result of the social and historical context she has been living in. To correctly decipher the main contribution we should be able to grasp this.

# Read it taking notes on the margins
Those are called marginalia and I haven't been using them since the beginning. I actually though to be an ominous crime to ruin let alone write on any book.
