Bitcoin has opened a branch on new research aspects, while establishing itself as a prominent example of a system whose practice precedes the theory. Nakamoto himself mentioned how he implemented the code first and worked on the whitepaper afterwards.<br> 
<br>	
The achievement of devising a decentralized cryptocurrency after 25 years of attempts is, as it sounds, impressive and is the result of both previous contributions and novelty elements.
The system stands as an outlier in the traditional computer science research methodology, first but not last for the anonymity of the creator.<br> 
<br>
Some aspects of Bitcoin can be formally analyzed up to a certain point, with some intractable elements of notable difficulty. In my opinion the beauty, and the value, of the system is related to the way it merges socioeconomical aspects (incentives for example) along with technical/technological one.<br>
<br>
The contribution of Bitcoin can be measured on multiple levels. To give an example, one level is key management. Users have become much more accustomed to managing private key, hardware wallets, while on the other side they have become much more user friendly.
To briefly mention the kind of existing wallets, they can be grouped in three macro areas:
* Local wallet. The private key is stored on a local file.
* Remote wallet. The private key is held by somebody else that you trust. 
* Offline wallet. Usually regarded as the most secure, the private key is outside the grid, let it be a piece of paper or your brain.<br>
<br>
Bitcoin has been devised about 10 years ago and due to its popularity, the volume of transactions has risen in a way that, maybe, hasn’t been foreseen during its creation. What we can say without much doubt is that the transaction throughput of Bitcoin can’t compete with other payment system such as Visa or Mastercard. If Bitcoin, or its successor, wants to impose itself as the main payment method, this has to be addressed.
The scalability problems can be conjugated in different planes, or aspects, that we list here briefly.<br>
<br>
1.	Network plane
2.	Consensus plane
3.	Storage plane
4.	View plane 
5.	Side plane<br>
<br>
The role of the research community can be to understand deeply and analyze key factors and tradeoffs of the design choice in order to steer improvements based on the use case at hand.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, Bitcoin came out as a solution for a long sought-after problem. It’s worth of research because it might hide some ingredients to tackle other problem’s solutions not yet solved.<br>
