A proxy is just a software platform, either virtual or physical, that sits in between the communication between the client and the server. The request is intercepted, elaborated and forwarded. We do this because we want to interrupt the point-to-point traffic flow to implement some functions that we are going to discuss.

Notably, there are two different kind of proxies that you can hear about:

* Forward proxy
* Reverse proxy

The first is the accumulation point for the clients, and is deployed inside or in proximity to the source network, while the second option sits near the server cluster.

## Forward proxy
In a simple architecture

Possible applications are:
* Authentication with corporate user base (e.g. Active Directory)
* URL inspection, filtering and reputation
* Malware scanning, usually asynchronous
    * Fingerprint based
    * Sandboxing
This can be done since the proxy acts as and encryption/decryption endpoint

## Reverse proxy
Those are used for the purpose of "shielding" the application server from incoming connections.

They can be used as
1. Load balancers:
    * DDoS mitigation
2. IP masking
3. Caching: some content is stored and if requested can be promptly sent back without even contacting the server
4. Encryption/decryption endpoint: on the public internet traffic has to travel encrypted, a RP can perform centrally this task, lessening the burden on the servers
